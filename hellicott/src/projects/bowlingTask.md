# Bowling Score Calculator Code Dojo

## Create a program which will take in a list of pins knocked down in a game of bowling and calculate the score


Example:
9,1,2,0,4,6,10,10,6,2,7,1,5,0,0,7,2,8,4
Score: 120

## When a player hits all 10 pins in one roll (a strike) they get the next two bowls doubled.
## When a player hits all 10 pins in 2 rolls (a spare) they get the next bowl doubled.

# On the final fram there is a possibility to get a third roll if all 10 pins are knocked down within the first two throws.

# Start with a simple calculation, ignoring some of these conditions and then use TDD to alter the code to work for as many conditions as you have time for
