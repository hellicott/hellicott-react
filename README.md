# hellicott-react

Website where I dump any projects I've played with - not necessarily completed or working!

## Projects
### Morse Code Translator
[code here](/hellicott/src/projects/morseCode.js)

A completed code dojo involving translating dots and dashes into text using a binary tree system (rather than a simple dictionary)

### Sprint Name Generator
[code here](/hellicott/src/projects/nameGenerator.js)

Randomly generate a fun name for a sprint from a large selection of adjectives and animals

### Bowling Score Calculator
[code here](/hellicott/src/projects/bowlingScore.js)

A task created to be done as a code dojo [instructions here](/hellicott/src/projects/bowlingTask.md) where you can enter a list of pins knowcked down per roll and it will calculate the final score, including doubles from spares and strikes

### Dino Designer
[code here](/hellicott/src/projects/svgDino.js)

A project involving manipulating svg attributes in order to design the colours of a dinosaur! Colour pickers come from the [react-color](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-color) package

### Random Colour Generator
[code here](/hellicott/src/projects/randomColour.js)

Each time you press the button a new random colour is generated and the background is set to this colour. The hex code for the colour can be copied to your clipboard (might not be working :/)

### [ARCHIVED] Rock Paper Scissors
[code here](/hellicott/src/projects/rockPaperScissors.js)

A simple game of rock paper scissors where you can select your choice and the opponent is a random generator
