# hellicott-react

Website where I dump any projects I've played with - not necessarily completed or working!

## Projects
### Bowling Score Calculator
[code here](/hellicott/src/projects/bowlingScore.js)

A task created to be done as a code dojo [instructions here](/hellicott/src/projects/bowlingTask.md) where you can enter a list of pins knowcked down per roll and it will calculate the final score, including doubles from spares and strikes

### Dino Designer
[code here](/hellicott/src/projects/svgDino.js)

A project involving manipulating svg attributes in order to design the colours of a dinosaur! Colour pickers come from the [react-color](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-color) package

### Random Colour Generator

Each time you press the button a new random colour is generated and the background is set to this colour. The hex code for the colour can be copied to your clipboard (might not be working :/)

### Rock Paper Scissors
